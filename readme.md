# C# Basic Challenges

Inspiration for these projects is taken from The Odin Project's [Ruby Programming assignments](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/tree/master/ruby_programming/basic_ruby_projects).

## Technologies

* .NET 5.0
* xUnit 

## How to Use

Individual problem domains sit in their own folders between the console application (ie. code relevant to solving the Caesar Cipher sits in the `CaesarCipher` folder). 

No use is made of `Program.cs` at this time. The code is tested via unit tests. The test project is set up in a similar structure. Simply run the suite of tests for a project to see the code in action.
